# Code-for-Multivariate-Inference-of-Network-Moments-by-Subsampling

This repository contains code and data used for all the plots in the paper

Project Structure
data/: Contains raw data files used in the analysis.
scripts/: Contains R scripts for processing data and generating plots.
plots/: Output directory for plots generated by the scripts.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Dependencies
This project requires R and the following R packages:

ggplot2: For data visualization.
scales: For scaling functions in ggplot2.
RColorBrewer: For color palettes.
ggExtra: For adding marginal plots to ggplot2 plots.
ggside: For adding side density plots to ggplot2 plots.
To install the required packages, run the following commands in your R console:

r
Copy code
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("scales")
install.packages("RColorBrewer")
install.packages("ggExtra")
install.packages("ggside")
Usage
Data Preparation
The data files are loaded and processed in the R scripts. The data is divided into different time periods (e.g., 2000-2004, 1995-1999, 1990-1994) for comparative analysis.

Plot Generation
The scripts/plot_generation.R script generates various plots that visualize the network statistics. The key plots include scatter plots with marginal density plots for 2-star vs. Triangle and other network motifs.
